                        Hey! I am a driven & ambitious developer with
                        a strong interest in back-end and AI.

                        Proven ability to work effectively both
                        independently and as part of a team.

                        Driven problem-solver with a passion for
                        innovation, optimization, and
                        automation, always striving to learn new
                        technologies and adapt to challenges.

                        Before finding my passion in IT and
                        programming, I worked as an electrician
                        for 9 years where I supervised & mentored several apprentices.

                                <p>Worked in a smaller team as an AI Developer, aside from the developer experience I
                                    received,
                                    we also had to work together with other teams, participate in meetings & collaborate
                                    with
                                    different roles and departments. We also had daily standups, where we would discuss
                                    problems, solutions and strategies. All this gave me great insight and experience in
                                    listening and understanding the needs, problems and how to solve them.</p>

                                <p>Worked as the sole developer on several projects with a steep learning curve. I would
                                    have
                                    weekly meetings with the whole team, and daily contact with the senior developers &
                                    owners
                                    for etc. instructions, support and questions. This gave me great experience in
                                    dealing with,
                                    and understanding complex information & tasks, as well as working independently and
                                    solving
                                    problems as they arose. I would also continuously demo my progress to the company
                                    and answer
                                    questions, giving me much experience in understanding the needs and acting on it.

                                <p>During an agile-methodologies course I was product owner and scrum master for a
                                    team-project,
                                    giving me invaluable insight into dealing not only with the technical aspects of
                                    driving a
                                    project and development team forward, but most importantly how to manage and
                                    understand
                                    people. We had several daily meetings, weekly planning phases and retrospectives,
                                    where we
                                    would talk about both the teams and each individuals, ex. conflicts, problems,
                                    needs, wants
                                    and improvement areas. My role as a scrum master was trying to solve the problems
                                    and meet
                                    these
                                    needs, both for each individual and for the group. This gave me invaluable
                                    experience in
                                    making sure the person was heard, understood and that I would handle any issues.</p>

                                <p>I also worked as an electrician for 9 years, where I had to deal with everyone from
                                    customers to department heads. I mentored several apprentices, which gave me
                                    valuable experience in teaching, listening, understanding, and addressing their
                                    challenges and needs. This role taught me the importance of patience and
                                    empathy, especially in a fast-paced environment. I had to connect with them on
                                    their level, adjusting my communication style from technical language to more
                                    accessible terms to ensure they could better understand, given their limited
                                    experience.</p>
